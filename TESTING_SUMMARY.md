## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### **1. Staging Deployment Problem**
```
Issue: https://staging-123hansa.vercel.app returns 404 for all routes
Likely Causes:
- Vercel build configuration issue
- Environment variables not set correctly
- Build output directory mismatch
- Routing configuration problem

To Fix:
1. Check Vercel dashboard for build logs
2. Verify vercel.json configuration
3. Ensure environment variables are set in Vercel
4. Redeploy with correct settings
```

### **2. Environment Variables Missing**
```
The API server failed to start due to missing:
- DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET

Need to configure .env file in apps/api/
```
